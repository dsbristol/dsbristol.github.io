# Data Science @ the [Institute for Statistical Science](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/), [University of Bristol](bristol.ac.uk/)

![What is Data Science?](_data/01.1-Intro_Data_Science_VD.png)

[dsbristol.github.io](dsbristol.github.io) exists to host to the more applied Data Science activities in the Institute, especially:

### [The Data Science Toolbox Course Website](https://dsbristol.github.io/dst)

## Some Data Science Nuggets

* How is data science used in practice?

## Wider Data Science Activity at the University of Bristol

There are many Data Science Activities undertaken at the University of Bristol, which falls under the umbrella of the [Jean Golding Institute for Data Intensive Research](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/).

The [Institute for Statistical Science](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/) is the Host for everything Statistical and Mathematical, with a focus on understanding Data Science methodology. There is a [Data Science Bristol](https://datascience.bris.ac.uk/) Blog run by the institute.

The [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://intelligentsystems.bristol.ac.uk/) is another core focus of activity, in the [Faculty of Engineering](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/).

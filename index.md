## Wider Data Science Activity at the University of Bristol

There are many Data Science Activities undertaken at the University of Bristol, which falls under the umbrella of the [Jean Golding Institute for Data Intensive Research](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/).

The [Institute for Statistical Science](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/) is the Host for everything Statistical and Mathematical, with a focus on understanding Data Science methodology. There is a [Data Science Bristol](https://datascience.bris.ac.uk/) Blog run by the institute.

Another core group is the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://intelligentsystems.bristol.ac.uk/) in the [Faculty of Engineering](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/).
